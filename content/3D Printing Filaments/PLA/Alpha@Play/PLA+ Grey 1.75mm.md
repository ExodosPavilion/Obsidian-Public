**PLA+** can be printed using both heated and non-heated beds. If you have a heated bed, temperatures between 50C-65C recommended. Suggested nozzle temperature is dependent on your printer but suggested ranges are between 190C and 215C.

Plastic has gotten tougher with our PLA+! And with better tensile strength, it also has higher impact resistance and less brittleness and deformation than typical PLA. With improved cooling, your overhangs will print even better, increasing your success rate for printing hanging models!
